## Quick Sort Algorithm [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Robert-Muraru-blue)](https://robert-muraru-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)


### Description
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm made up of a series of instructions that takes an array as input. It performs specified operations on the array, sometimes called a list, and outputs a sorted array.
 Efficient sorting is important for optimizing the use of other algorithms (such as search and merge algorithms) which require input data to be in sorted lists.

### [Quick Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
    * Quicksort is an in-place sorting algorithm.
    * Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. 
    * It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two 
    sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
    * Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" 
    relation is defined.
    * Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes O(n log n) comparisons
    to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes O(nÂ²) comparisons, though this behavior is rare.
